# **Happr - Send Smiles, Support Dreams**

## Overview
Happr is a modern web application template built with React, Vite, and TypeScript, designed for seamless deployment on Vercel. It demonstrates a foundational setup for a client-side application capable of interacting with serverless functions. üöÄ

## Features
- **Modern Frontend Stack**: Leverages React for dynamic user interfaces, Vite for fast development, and TypeScript for robust type safety.
- **Optimized Development Experience**: Utilizes Vite for an incredibly fast development server and efficient build process.
- **Serverless Function Integration**: Demonstrates interaction with backend serverless functions (simulated via `/api/handler` endpoint) for both GET and POST requests.
- **Vercel Deployment Ready**: Configured for straightforward deployment to Vercel, ideal for projects utilizing serverless architecture.
- **Linting & Formatting**: Enforces code quality and consistency with ESLint and TypeScript ESLint configurations.

## Getting Started
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Installation
‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Charmingdc/Happr
cd Happr/client
```

üì¶ **Install Dependencies**:
```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables
This project currently does not require any specific environment variables for local development beyond what is handled by Vite's default setup.

## Usage
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Run Development Server**:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the Vite development server, usually accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

Upon launching the application, you will see a simple interface that demonstrates fetching data from a serverless function via a GET request and sending data via a POST request.

- The "GET Request Response" section will automatically display a message fetched from the `/api/handler` endpoint on page load.
- The "POST Request Response" section allows you to click a button to send a POST request to the same endpoint and view its response.
