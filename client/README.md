# Happr: Made with Love. Paid in Smiles. ✨

## Project Overview

Happr is a modern and engaging landing page for a platform designed to empower creators by enabling their fans to send "Smiles" – instant tips directly to their accounts. Built with cutting-edge frontend technologies, Happr provides a seamless and delightful user experience, showcasing the platform's benefits and ease of use.

## Features

*   **Interactive Landing Page:** A dynamic and engaging single-page application built with React, featuring smooth animations powered by `motion/react`.
*   **Modern UI/UX:** A clean, vibrant, and responsive user interface crafted with Tailwind CSS for a contemporary aesthetic across all devices.
*   **Creator-Centric Workflow:** Clearly outlines the process for creators to set up their page, share their link, and receive support from their audience.
*   **Transparent Pricing Model:** Illustrates a straightforward 95% payout structure for creators, emphasizing fairness and clarity.
*   **Nigerian Creator Focus:** Tailored for the Nigerian creative community, leveraging Paystack for secure and instant transactions (conceptualized on the frontend).
*   **Robust Development Environment:** Utilizes TypeScript for type safety and maintainability, ensuring a stable and scalable codebase.
*   **Optimized Performance:** Bundled with Vite for an exceptionally fast development experience and optimized production builds.
