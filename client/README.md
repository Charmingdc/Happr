This platform provides a seamless and transparent way for creators, especially in Nigeria, to monetize their passion with direct payouts, powered by Paystack.

*   üìù **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and sign-in processes for creators to manage their Happr page.
*   üîó **Customizable Page Claiming**: Allows creators to claim a unique `happr.me/username` link for their profile.
*   ‚ö° **Instant Payouts**: Designed to facilitate immediate fund transfers to creators' bank accounts upon receiving "Smiles."
*   üì± **Responsive Design**: A fully responsive interface that delivers an optimal experience across all devices.
*   üöÄ **Smooth UI Animations**: Utilizes the Motion library for delightful and fluid user interface transitions and interactions.

## Getting Started

To get Happr up and running locally, follow these simple steps.

### Installation
1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Charmingdc/Happr
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Happr
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Happr uses `npm` for package management.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or if you prefer Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
    or pnpm:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

### Environment Variables
This project currently does not require any specific environment variables for local development as it's a frontend application. However, a backend API would typically require:

*   `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: The base URL for the Happr API (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/api/v1`).

## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start the development server to view the Happr application in your browser.

1.  **Start the Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command will start the Vite development server, usually accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

2.  **Explore the Landing Page**:
    Upon opening the application, you will land on the main marketing page, which introduces Happr and its core functionalities.

3.  **Sign Up / Sign In**:
    *   Click on "Get Started" or "Sign up" to navigate to the registration page.
    *   You will first be prompted to choose a unique username for your Happr page.
    *   After choosing a username, you can proceed with email/password registration or use the "Continue with Google" option.
    *   Existing users can navigate to the "/signin" route to log into their accounts.

4.  **Enjoy the Experience**:
    The application provides an intuitive interface for creators to set up their profiles and begin receiving support. While the payment processing itself would involve a backend, the frontend provides the full user journey for registration and page setup.
